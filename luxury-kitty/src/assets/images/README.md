# Photo Gallery Images

Upload your 40+ photos here for the Polaroid gallery.

## Instructions:
1. Add your image files to this folder (`.jpg`, `.png`, `.webp` formats work best)
2. Name them sequentially: `photo-1.jpg`, `photo-2.jpg`, etc. (or any naming convention)
3. The component will automatically load up to 40 images
4. Images will be displayed in the floating Polaroid frames around Hello Kitty

## Recommended:
- Image size: 800x1000px or similar portrait orientation
- Format: JPG or PNG
- File size: Keep under 500KB per image for fast loading

## Note:
If you have fewer than 40 images, the component will cycle through available images or show placeholders for missing ones.
